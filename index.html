    <p class="font">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, Indian subcontinent, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>

     <!-- house blend -->

     <h2>House Blend Coffee</h2>
     <img src="./images/house-blend.jpeg" alt="house blend coffe" width="40%">
     <p style="width:50%">It’s deceptively simple. A blend of fine Latin American beans roasted to a glistening, dark chestnut color. Loaded with flavor, balancing tastes of nut and cocoa, just a touch of sweetness from the roast. This coffee is our beginning, the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. And this one blend set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and a delicious cup of coffee, period. It all starts from here.

Coffee brewed from French roasted beans will have the natural characteristic flavors of the bean muted, particularly any acidic notes. Bittersweet tones from the roast will dominate the flavor. French roast coffees are prevalent in coffee associated with the American West. This roast profile is also commonly used in American espresso.

    <h2>Columbian roast</h2>
    <img src="./images/columbian-roast.jpeg" alt="columbian roast coffee" width="40%">
    <p style="width:50%">A lot of good comes from Colombia: Colombian food, music, and, of course, coffee. It’s believed that a priest by the name of Francisco Romero asked people to plant coffee trees. From there, it spanned to be so popular that planting coffee trees became a general practice that transformed Colombia into one of the world's largest coffee-producing countries.
